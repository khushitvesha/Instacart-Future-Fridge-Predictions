## Executive Summary
The aim of this project is to predict which previously purchased products will appear in a user's next order, based on their historical data. This will potentially increase customer satisfaction and loyalty by providing personalized recommendations and improving the overall shopping experience.

## Data Preparation
- **Database Size:** 324,345 rows, 15 columns sampled from 30+ million records.
- **Sampling:** Data reduced to 1% for manageability.
- **Normalization:** Standard Scaler used for standardization of numerical columns.

## Problem Statement
Enhance the shopping experience by predicting user preferences and suggesting relevant products, thereby improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Methodologies
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzed order distributions, reorder frequencies, and department popularity.
- **Market Basket Analysis:** Employed to identify strong product associations.
- **K-means Clustering:** Used for customer segmentation.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Applied PCA and t-SNE for better visualization and interpretation of data.
- **Hierarchical Clustering:** Utilized for deeper insights into customer grouping.

## Challenges
- **Large Data:** Required extensive sampling due to computational limits, leading to potential loss of subtle patterns.
- **Market Basket Analysis:** Computational challenges faced with extensive product combinations.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Techniques like t-SNE and Hierarchical clustering required resampling for feasibility.

## Business Relevance
This analysis allows for:
- **Personalized Marketing Campaigns:** Better customer targeting through detailed segmentation.
